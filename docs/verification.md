# Verification and known limits

ClawMinutes is an experimental source release. These observations come from development checks on 1 and 2 October 2026. Private recordings, meeting content, machine identifiers, credentials, and runtime receipts are not part of the public repository.

## Observed behavior

- Local Parakeet recognition produced timestamped transcripts on the recording Mac. A synthetic recognition run also completed with networking denied.
- Application-filtered, audio-only ScreenCaptureKit capture produced separate microphone and system CAF tracks. The capture path registers no screen output.
- The helper saved text transcripts through the authenticated Gateway and read back the Meetings archive.
- A real completed meeting produced Gateway AI notes with the configured model. Successful note generation does not prove general Gateway event-loop or memory health.
- Timestamped Teams observations supported participant names in real transcripts. Other segments remained Unknown speaker.
- Audio was automatically removed after a real finished meeting passed transcript, archive, export, and coverage checks. Text artifacts and deletion receipts remained.
- Generated notes folders were migrated to timestamp-and-title names. Notes and transcript hashes were unchanged, and current recording/export pointers were checked.
- Updates signed with the same local certificate retained the helper's designated signing requirement. This is local signing, not Developer ID notarization.

## Limits

- Native source builds currently require Xcode 27.2 beta with Swift 6.4. Stable Xcode 16.4 and 26.3 failed clean builds.
- The archive adapter supports only OpenClaw 2026.9.7 and uses an internal store interface. Other versions fail closed.
- Meeting titles, call clocks, and participant lists depend on available Teams UI evidence. Observations are partial. A stale title must not be treated as evidence of the current call.
- Unknown speaker labels remain when identity evidence is absent or ambiguous. Acoustic clusters and roster membership do not establish identity.
- Some development captures had incomplete microphone coverage. The helper checks microphone startup and retains audio when coverage verification fails. It does not yet recover a later stalled route by starting a new capture segment.
- A prior Core Audio tap hung during callback registration. Production uses ScreenCaptureKit; the original tap is retained for provenance and is not a silent fallback.
- ElevenLabs support is implemented, but a real cloud transcription was not verified in the development acceptance run.
- A live desktop theme toggle was not observed. Light and dark icon renders were inspected separately.
- Capture fixtures, injected speaker names, and unit tests are not live-call acceptance evidence.

Run the tests documented in the README for the current checkout. Hardware, credential, and model tests need separate setup. Keep live-call verification separate from unit-test results.
